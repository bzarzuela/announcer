Email Announcement System

- Companies need a way to allow users to easily send notices to everyone in the company.
- Those who can send notices must be able to pick the recipients easily.
- The best way to do it is by choosing departments.
- Users should be able to create departments as needed.

- Users should be able to send file attachments.
- Users should be able to see a history of announcements sent.
- Users should be able to see which messages have been sent to what user.
- The sending email address will be the email address of the user.
- Users should be able to see who has downloaded the attachments on the email.
- This is great for ensuring that users have viewed the required attachments of an announcement.

Things we have to watch out for:

- To not trigger SPAM quotas, sending will be limited to 180 recipients per hour.
- File attachments will be converted to links in the message to files stored in the application. Doing it this way reduces load on the mail server and allows a company proxy server to cache the file reducing the bandwidth requirements for the company.
- To reduce false positives for virus scanners, message format will be text only. 
- For rich formatted messages, recommendation is to attach PDF or Word document of the announcement with the message.
